# WDI Project 1 -- Hangman


One of the more difficult projects I've had to create. This was a hangman created with (mostly) vanilla JS.

##Description 
NOTE: Currently not fully functional.

The game of hangman is pretty simple to play but not as simple to code. Simply a game where you are given a word to guess and have the english alphabet to choose from. You can only use each letter once and are given six lives.
If the letter is correct the letter will be revealed in the hidden word and the letter is removed from play. If the guess was incorrect, one of your initial seven lives are taken from you.

## Planning and Preperation
The initial planning phase was very light. Understanding the game was not the hard part. Planning out user stories and the overall logic of it all was the biggest part of planning that I need to work on. 

## The Code

My initial starting point was with the HTML since that would take the least amount of work. The hard part came when I added buttons. Buttons don't work in the console how you would expect them to and this was a MAJOR setback.

## VERSION 2 

In the future, I hope to make it fully functional and use HTML5 Canvas to animate the hanging man.
